# CMPT 276 - Assignment 2
The code in this repo implements the minimum requirements for this assignment, as per the spec on Canvas.

The implemented features are the following:
- Going to URL displays the students as colored boxes
    - Color corresponds to the hair color
    - The width of each box is proportional to the weight of the person
    - The height of each box is proportional to the height of the person
- A new student can be added using the `Add New Student` link on the main page
- An existing student's info can be updated using the `Edit` button in each student box
- During the student creation or editing phase, if you change your mind and do not want to go through with the action, you can `Cancel`. 
- An existing student can be deleted using the `Delete` button in each student's box
